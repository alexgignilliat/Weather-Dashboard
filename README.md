# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This is a weather created using the OpenWeatherMap API. This was a huge learning experience, and while there are still a few things I'm working out, it's generally how I envisioned it. I went into this not knowing a ton about APIs, and although I most definitely have a lot more to learn, I believe I now have a solid foundation to build upon.

## Installation

Clone to your local machine and open in your favorite code editor to check it out! Or visit the deployed version at: [Day Planner on GitHub Pages](https://alexgignilliat.github.io/Day-Planner/)

## Technologies Utilized

HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript, jQuery, OpenWeatherMap API

## Information, Important Notes, etc

I started building this application at a time when I was just getting my feet wet with APIs and JavaScript in general. That being said, the end goal for this application is:

- On first page load, display user's location on screen rather than the default or last searched city
- Differentiate between different states (example: there's a Las Vegas in Nevada as well as in New Mexico. There's a fun fact for you, absolutely free of charge!)

â€œRemember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the Universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up."  - Stephen Hawking
